Allow your users to purchase and send gift cards, an easy and direct way to encourage new sales.

== Description ==

**[Free live demo >](https://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-card-free/)**

The projected market, of the last years’ trends, expects that in 2024 gift card sales will hit an income of 698 billion dollars to companies all over the world.

It's a staggering amount of money, yet we are not surprised. Who wouldn't prefer a gift card to an item purchased carelessly by someone who maybe doesn't even really know what you would like to receive on our birthday or at Christmas?

Gift cards are also appreciated by people buying them. What a waste of time looking for the right gift risking to buy something they might not like or that could be of the wrong size or color!

A Christmas gift for a friend, a present for a relative's birthday, a Christmas bonus for employees: a gift card is always the best choice. For that reason, all the biggest e-commerce shops offer their customers the possibility to purchase gift cards.

By offering your users the possibility to purchase a gift card to spend on your shop, you will be able to gain new customers (the person receiving the gift card will know about your products, will place an order and will be encouraged to buy again so you can loyalize him/her) and considerably increase your earnings.

The new version of our YITH WooCommerce Gift Card is the free and easy solution to start selling gift cards on your e-commerce. We have updated the plugin to make it even more effective, innovative and easier to use.


= How does it work? =

You only have to install the plugin, create your first gift card and publish it: a few-minutes process that will let you start offering gift cards immediately to your customers.

The user's interface is very easy and based on Amazon's one: your customers can choose one of the amounts you set, select an image to customize the gift card (our plugin is the only one that lets you upload an unlimited image gallery!), insert the receiver's details, add a message and, finally, purchase the gift card like any other product on your e-commerce store.


= Main features =

* A new product type, Gift-card, to configure your own gift cards.
* Set the amount you want to use for each Gift Card.
* Dashboard with all gift cards (to check balance, related orders and so on)
* Create and edit Gift Cards from the Gift Cards dashboard
* Create and sell Virtual Gift Cards
* Create unlimited physical or virtual gift cards;
* Let the customer fill the recipient’s data and send the gift card via email
* Email the gift card to the recipient once the order has been completed.
* Create a gallery of images and allow customers to choose one for the gift card layout
* Customize the Gift Card code pattern

= Can I edit the format used? =

Yes, the format can be edited in the plugin settings.

= Why haven't I received the email containing the gift card code? =

The gift card code is generated only after the order status goes to "processing" or "complete" and therefore it will be sent to the email address entered.

= What happens if the customers spend less than the total card amount? =

Each time the gift card is used, the available credit is updated and if there's some left, it can be used for future purchases.
